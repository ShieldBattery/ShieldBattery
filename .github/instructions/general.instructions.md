- Include comments only for code that needs further explanation or is particularly tricky. Avoid
  comments like `Define foo` before variable declarations.
- Don't remove TODO comments unless the TODO has been completed. Leave them unmodified, including
  any thing inside `TODO()` e.g. `TODO(tec27):` or `TODO(#1337):`.
- Text-based files should have unix style line endings (LF only).
- If you need further context about types or behavior, ask for clarification.
