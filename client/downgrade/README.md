This folder contains the functionality for downgrading StarCraft versions from higher -> lower.
It was added as a way to support new patches by downgrading them to the one we supported (1.16.1).
However, with our new SC:R support, this system is not necessary anymore (at least for now), and is
thus turned off in code with a feature flag.

Consider this folder legacy at this point.
