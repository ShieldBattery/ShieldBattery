    question: 'When will the open beta start?',
    answer: [
      <p key="p1">
        Open beta will start once ShieldBattery is stable and ready for the public. An exact ETA for
        this is unfortunately impossible to give, but expect to receive regular updates from us as
        we make progress. Make sure to follow our{' '}

      <p key="p2">
        Even before the open beta starts, we'll be inviting new users to our closed beta
        periodically. So if you're interested in helping us test the software, finding bugs, and
        giving feedback before it's available to a wider audience, please{' '}

    ],
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the status of the closed beta?',
    answer: [
      <p key="p1">
        The closed beta is currently running, and will last until we feel that the feature set is
        relatively complete, polished, and bug-free. Our current beta invitees have given us tons of
        great feedback, and the software is under active development to improve and polish things
        based on their responses. While the basics of the features we've promised are in place, we
        are also still actively working on some of the more complex pieces, such as matchmaking.
      </p>,

      <p key="p2">
        As these features come online, we'll need a larger player-base in order to test them, so
        please <Link to="/splash">sign up</Link> for a chance to get invited.

  {
    question: 'Will ShieldBattery cost anything? Is there a way to donate?',
    answer: [
      <p key="p1">
        Of course not. This is a project made purely out of our love for BW; by community members,
        for the community.
      </p>,
      <p key="p2">
        As for the donation link, there isn't one at this time. The server costs are currently very
        manageable, and we'd prefer the community directed their funds to more needy causes.
      </p>,
    ],
  },
  {
    question: 'Will the project be open source?',
    answer: (
      <span>
        Yes, it will. Shortly after we enter the open beta, all of the code used in the project will
        be posted publicly on GitHub.
      </span>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the system requirements to play on ShieldBattery?',
    answer: (
      <ul>
        <li>A computer running Windows 7 or later</li>
        <li>A graphics card that supports either DirectX 10+ or OpenGL 3.1+</li>
        <li>A Brood War installation, patched to version 1.16.1 or greater</li>
      </ul>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'Does ShieldBattery work on Linux or OS X?',
    answer: (
      <span>
        This is not currently something we're focusing on, but we do have plans to ensure that
        ShieldBattery is usable via Wine. For now, however, it is Windows-only.
      </span>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'Will there be matchmaking for non-1v1 match types, such as 2v2 or UMS?',
    answer: (
      <span>
        Our initial focus for matchmaking is on 1v1 matches, but we are open to adding other sorts
        of matchmaking in the future, if player interest is sufficient to sustain it. Our platform
        is definitely flexible enough to support all of these things.
      </span>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'Does the windowed mode allow widescreen resolutions or larger viewports?',
    answer: (
      <span>
        No, our windowed mode only allows 4:3 aspect ratios, and always scales the sprites to the
        new resolution (meaning that even at larger resolutions, the same portion of the map is
        visible as at the original, 640x480 resolution). We're not opposed to such things for
        observers, but our focus right now is largely on the playing experience.
      </span>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'Is hotkey customization allowed or provided?',
    answer: (
      <span>
        Currently no, but we plan to implement built-in hotkey customization and presets at some
        point in the future.
      </span>
