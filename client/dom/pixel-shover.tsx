 * A hook that will measure a specific element on a resize and return how many pixels centered items

 *
 * This is mainly useful for things that are centered in their parents, especially via
 * `margin: auto` or flexbox. In such cases, the browser will position their left edge on a half
 * pixel, which can make everything inside of them blurry.
 *
 * @param measuredElement which element to measure when the window is resized. Defaults to the
 * document body
 *
 * @returns a tuple of [x shove, y shove]
