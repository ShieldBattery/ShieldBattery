# DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY EXCEPT FOR `types.ts`

These files are generated, and should not be edited manually.

To regenerate them, run:

```
pnpm run gen-graphql
```

`types.ts` is for re-exporting common types we want to use for GraphQL scalars (e.g. SbUserId), so
only add types there if you're doing that.
