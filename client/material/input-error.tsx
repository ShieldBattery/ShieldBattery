  // `ErrorText` div gets animated just fine on exit, but not its content, the text that we actually
  // want to animate. Technically, we could probably use the `addEndListener` property to keep the
  // text content in the DOM until the exit transition finishes, but that would be pretty hacky so
  // we wen't with the second option.
  // Second option is using the `TransitionGroup` component which can render `null` as its children
  // and it keeps the text content in the DOM until the exit transition finishes, animating the text
  // just as we want (`CSSTransition` can't have `null` as its children).
