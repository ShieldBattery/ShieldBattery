# Useful database queries

If you're running your database via docker-compose, you can connect to it via `psql` by doing:

```sh
docker exec -it shieldbattery_db_1 psql -U postgres --dbname shieldbattery
```

(Connecting with other installed clients will also work, provided its network is accessible to you.)

## Median Matchmaking Cancel Time

```sql
SELECT matchmaking_type, percentile_cont(0.5)
WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY search_time_millis)
FILTER (WHERE completion_type = 'cancel')
FROM matchmaking_completions
GROUP BY matchmaking_type;
```

## Recent game rally-point routes + estimated latency, 1 route per row

Change the first common table expression to select the game entries you care about.

```sql
WITH game_routes AS (
	SELECT g.id, g.start_time, g.routes FROM games g
	WHERE g.routes IS NOT NULL
	ORDER BY g.start_time DESC
	LIMIT 10
) SELECT g.id AS game_id, u1.name AS p1, u2.name AS p2, r.description AS "server", g.route->>'latency' AS latency
FROM (SELECT g.id, UNNEST(g.routes) AS route, g.start_time FROM game_routes g) g
JOIN rally_point_servers r ON (route->>'server')::NUMERIC = r.id
JOIN users u1 ON (g.route->>'p1')::NUMERIC = u1.id
JOIN users u2 ON (g.route->>'p2')::NUMERIC = u2.id
ORDER BY g.start_time, p1;
```

## Veto count for each map in the current map pool

This query returns maps grouped by each matchmaking type, but it's easy to add a filter for a
single matchmaking type if you're interested in only one.

```sql
WITH mmp AS (
  SELECT matchmaking_type, MAX(id) AS current_map_pool
  FROM matchmaking_map_pools
  GROUP BY matchmaking_type
)
SELECT name, COUNT(*) AS vetoes, matchmaking_type
FROM (
  SELECT unnest(map_selections) AS map_id, map_pool_id
  FROM matchmaking_preferences
) mp
INNER JOIN uploaded_maps um ON um.id = mp.map_id
INNER JOIN mmp ON mmp.current_map_pool = mp.map_pool_id
GROUP BY name, matchmaking_type
ORDER BY matchmaking_type, vetoes DESC;
```

## Count matchmaking games by season and type

```sql
WITH seasons AS (
	SELECT ms.id, ms.start_date, LEAD(ms.start_date, 1) OVER (ORDER BY start_date) end_date, ms.name
	FROM matchmaking_seasons ms
	ORDER BY start_date DESC
)
SELECT s.name, g.config->'gameSourceExtra'->>'type', COUNT(*)
FROM games g
JOIN seasons s
ON g.start_time >= s.start_date
AND g.start_time < s.end_date
WHERE g.config->>'gameSource' = 'MATCHMAKING'
GROUP BY s.name, g.config->'gameSourceExtra'->>'type'
ORDER BY s.name, g.config->'gameSourceExtra'->>'type';
```

## Count the number of matchmaking games played for each player in a given time period

You can adjust the query to count the games for a different matchmaking type and/or a different time
period. Keep in mind that the database is using the UTC time zone.

```sql
SELECT u.name AS user_name, COUNT(gu.game_id) AS games_played
FROM games_users gu
INNER JOIN users u ON gu.user_id = u.id
INNER JOIN games g ON gu.game_id = g.id
WHERE
  gu.start_time >= '2022-11-30 23:00:00' AND
  gu.start_time < '2023-01-01 01:00:00' AND
  g.config->>'gameSource' = 'MATCHMAKING' AND
  g.config->'gameSourceExtra'->>'type' = '2v2'
GROUP BY user_name
ORDER BY games_played DESC;
```

## Count the number of matchmaking games in a given time period

By default, the query shows the number of 1v1 matchmaking games in the past 30 days. Includes the
dates with 0 games played (so the output can be easily fed into a line chart).

```sql
WITH g AS (
  SELECT date_trunc('day', start_time)::date AS date, COUNT(*) AS games_count
  FROM games
  WHERE
    config->>'gameSource' = 'MATCHMAKING' AND
    config->'gameSourceExtra'->>'type' = '1v1'
  GROUP BY date
)
SELECT date_trunc('day', days)::date AS date, COALESCE(g.games_count, 0) AS games_count
FROM generate_series(NOW() - INTERVAL '30 day', NOW(), INTERVAL '1 day') days
LEFT JOIN g ON date_trunc('day', days)::date = g.date
GROUP BY days, games_count
ORDER BY days;
```

## Calculate the matchup stats for each map in a given league

This query assumes a 1v1 league. Calculating stats for 2v2 leagues is left as an exercise to the
reader.

```sql
WITH
lg AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT(game_id)
  FROM league_user_changes
  WHERE league_id = ${leagueId}
),
stats AS (
  SELECT
    m.name AS map_name,
    COUNT(g.id) AS total_games,
    COUNT(g.id) FILTER (WHERE g.results @> '[[{"race":"p", "result":"win"}],[{"race":"z", "result":"loss"}]]') AS pvz_wins,
    COUNT(g.id) FILTER (WHERE g.results @> '[[{"race":"p", "result":"loss"}],[{"race":"z", "result":"win"}]]') AS pvz_losses,
    COUNT(g.id) FILTER (WHERE g.results @> '[[{"race":"p", "result":"win"}],[{"race":"t", "result":"loss"}]]') AS pvt_wins,
    COUNT(g.id) FILTER (WHERE g.results @> '[[{"race":"p", "result":"loss"}],[{"race":"t", "result":"win"}]]') AS pvt_losses,
    COUNT(g.id) FILTER (WHERE g.results @> '[[{"race":"t", "result":"win"}],[{"race":"z", "result":"loss"}]]') AS tvz_wins,
    COUNT(g.id) FILTER (WHERE g.results @> '[[{"race":"t", "result":"loss"}],[{"race":"z", "result":"win"}]]') AS tvz_losses,
    COUNT(g.id) FILTER (WHERE g.results @> '[[{"race":"t", "result":"win"}],[{"race":"p", "result":"loss"}]]') AS tvp_wins,
    COUNT(g.id) FILTER (WHERE g.results @> '[[{"race":"t", "result":"loss"}],[{"race":"p", "result":"win"}]]') AS tvp_losses,
    COUNT(g.id) FILTER (WHERE g.results @> '[[{"race":"z", "result":"win"}],[{"race":"p", "result":"loss"}]]') AS zvp_wins,
    COUNT(g.id) FILTER (WHERE g.results @> '[[{"race":"z", "result":"loss"}],[{"race":"p", "result":"win"}]]') AS zvp_losses,
    COUNT(g.id) FILTER (WHERE g.results @> '[[{"race":"z", "result":"win"}],[{"race":"t", "result":"loss"}]]') AS zvt_wins,
    COUNT(g.id) FILTER (WHERE g.results @> '[[{"race":"z", "result":"loss"}],[{"race":"t", "result":"win"}]]') AS zvt_losses
  FROM games g
  INNER JOIN uploaded_maps m ON g.map_id = m.id
  INNER JOIN lg ON g.id = game_id
  GROUP BY m.name
)
SELECT
  map_name,
  total_games,
  pvz_wins || '-' || pvz_losses AS pvz_stats,
  ROUND(pvz_wins::decimal / (pvz_wins + pvz_losses) * 100, 2) || '%' AS pvz_rate,
  pvt_wins || '-' || pvt_losses AS pvt_stats,
  ROUND(pvt_wins::decimal / (pvt_wins + pvt_losses) * 100, 2) || '%' AS pvt_rate,
  tvz_wins || '-' || tvz_losses AS tvz_stats,
  ROUND(tvz_wins::decimal / (tvz_wins + tvz_losses) * 100, 2) || '%' AS tvz_rate,
  tvp_wins || '-' || tvp_losses AS tvp_stats,
  ROUND(tvp_wins::decimal / (tvp_wins + tvp_losses) * 100, 2) || '%' AS tvp_rate,
  zvp_wins || '-' || zvp_losses AS zvp_stats,
  ROUND(zvp_wins::decimal / (zvp_wins + zvp_losses) * 100, 2) || '%' AS zvp_rate,
  zvt_wins || '-' || zvt_losses AS zvt_stats,
  ROUND(zvt_wins::decimal / (zvt_wins + zvt_losses) * 100, 2) || '%' AS zvt_rate
FROM stats;
```

# Creating a readonly role and user logins

These must be executed as the superuser.

```sql
