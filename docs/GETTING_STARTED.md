# Getting Started

## Developer setup

ShieldBattery is a combination of C++ and JavaScript, and split between multiple server and client
pieces. Even if you only plan on developing JavaScript changes, you'll need to install the C++
dependencies in order to properly test things.

### Repository setup

We use a git submodule for the node dependency, which needs to be initialized after a fresh
repository clone. Run `git submodule init` followed by `git submodule update` to make this happen.
Whenever the node dependency has been updated, you'll then need to re-run `git submodule update` to
get the new changes.

### General environment setup

#### Python 2.7.x

ShieldBattery uses [gyp](https://gyp.gsrc.io/) for generating the game client project files, which
requires a working [Python 2.7.x](http://www.python.org/download/) install. Install this before
attempting to follow further steps.

### JavaScript

All of the JavaScript will either run in, or be built by, [node.js](https://nodejs.org). You'll need
to install a version of it, generally the current version is a good choice (8.1.4 at the time of
writing). The version you install does not need to match the version that the game client's
submodule is tagged to.

#### Yarn

The various JavaScript components use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to manage their dependencies.
Install the latest version of it from their [downloads page](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

### C++

Building the C++ code requires Visual Studio 2015 or higher. The easiest/cheapest way to get this
is through the
[Community edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx).

Once Visual Studio is installed, you can generate project files by running the `vcbuild.bat` script in the
[`game` directory](../game). If you plan on building inside of Visual Studio, you can run this with the
`nobuild` flag to speed things up. Note that this script will also install JS dependencies for the game
side of things.

`vcbuild.bat` will generate `game.sln` in the same folder; open this with Visual Studio to be
able to edit and build the C++ code. Note that Debug builds add significant startup time to the
applications, while Release builds add significant compile time. Pick your poison based on your needs at the
time.

If you should ever need to add or remove files to the projects, make the changes in `game.gyp` and
then re-run the build script to regenerate projects. This will ensure everyone can get to the same project
state as you, once your changes are merged.

### Server software

Along with nodejs, the server requires [PostgreSQL v9.4+](http://postgresql.org), and
[redis](http://redis.io).

#### PostgreSQL

On Windows, use the installer available [here](http://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/). On
Linux, this can generally be installed through the package manager for your OS. On Mac, use
[brew](http://brew.sh).

The PostgreSQL must be started and running with a user configured (remember what the username and
password are for this account, you'll need it when configuring the ShieldBattery server).

Detailed guides can be found at
[the PostgreSQL wiki](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides). A simpler
guide can also be found
[here](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2009/04/linux-postgresql-install-and-configure-from-source/).

You will need some extensions set up for our schema to work properly, run the following commands
as your database super-user (generally, `postgres`):

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS citext WITH SCHEMA public;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp" WITH SCHEMA public;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm WITH SCHEMA public;
```

Note that these must be run on the database you've created for ShieldBattery (e.g. you should
choose that DB first, with `\c <yourDBname>` or something similar).

#### Redis

On Windows, use the installers provided by MSOpenTech; they can be found [here](https://github.com/MSOpenTech/redis/releases). Note that only 64-bit installers are provided.
On Linux, this can generally be installed through the package manage for your OS. On Mac, use
[brew](http://brew.sh).

On Windows, redis service is started automatically if you use the above installer. on Linux/Mac, start the
redis server by using

```
redis-server
```

For more documentation, check out the [redis docs](http://redis.io/documentation).

### Configuring the ShieldBattery server

Inside the `server` folder, copy `config.example.js` and `database.example.json` to `config.js` and
`database.json`, respectively. Edit these files as you see fit to match your local configuration.

### Installing dependencies

Every directory with a `yarn.lock` needs to have it's dependencies installed with Yarn. You can do
this manually, or simply run `yarnall` from the root directory:

```
yarn run yarnall
```

This should be done every time a `yarn.lock` file changes in the repository.

### Initialize the database structure

**NOTE**: PostgreSQL must be properly configured beforehand for the db-migrate scripts to work.

**NOTE**: an existing `DATABASE_URL` environment variable will take precedence over `database.json`
and should be removed or updated to match your desired database configuration.

Change into the `server` directory, then migrate the database to the latest structure with:

```
yarn run migrate-up
```

You will need to run this command after pulling in commits that change the database structure as
well.

### Set up map system

The server needs access to some of BW's data files in order to generate map images. Download an mpq editor,
such as [this one](http://www.zezula.net/en/mpq/download.html) and make sure to download "listfiles" from
that website as well, which you'll need to use in the mpq editor. Use the mpq editor to extract BW's data
files from `stardat.mpq`, `broodat.mpq`, in that order, having `broodat.mpq` overwrite any conflicting files
from `stardat.mpq`. The necessary directories in .mpq files are `unit/` and `tileset/`. Extract those files
to a directory (keeping the directory structure), and set `config.bwData` in server's `config.js` to that
directory.

Set `config.fileStore` in the `config.js` to the directory that you wish to use for uploaded maps and their
images (see example in `config.example.js`). Now you can use the admin panel and "Mass map upload" feature to
upload any map(s) from your hard disk to the server. If you wish to upload official maps, you can download
them from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B76qCUchMgsnb0dla2V2NEdDVTQ/).

### Run the server

The standard way to run the server is (from the `server` directory):

```
yarn start
```

This command will format and colorize the log output, but if you want/need the raw output you can
also use:

```
node index.js
```

#### Overriding the server URL (optional)

It is possible to override the server's URL with environment variables. Two levels of environment variables:
- **Build time**: `SB_SERVER` set in the environment that runs the webpack dev server will pick the
"default" server for that build. If none is set, the default will be, in `NODE_ENV=production`,
`https://shieldbattery.net`, or otherwise, the canonical URL set in your local server config.
- **Run time**: `SB_SERVER` set in the environment that runs the app (`yarn run app` or just running the
actual packaged executable).

Note: run time takes precedence over build time.
