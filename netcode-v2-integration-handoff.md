# Netcode v2 (rally-point2) — game integration handoff

Status as of 2026-07-01, branch `rp2-integration`. This picks up where the first integration slice
(commit `bd6e86129`) left off. Read alongside `scr-netcode-replacement-guide.md` (the seam RE) and
`netcode-v2-build-plan.md` (WS-A). rally-point2 is pinned as a git dependency; the client API you
consume is documented in `../rally-point2/docs/architecture.md` and its `client/` crate.

## Decisions locked (with the team)

- **Scope B — all transport on rp2, no rally-point v1.** In-game *and* lobby turns leave Storm via
  the seam. Storm's **join/session handshake** packets still originate in Storm, but they surface to
  us through the existing SNP provider (`snp.rs::send_packet`), and the plan is to reroute them off
  that shim onto an rp2 **reliable/opaque channel** instead of rally-point v1 UDP. End state: one
  QUIC connection, v1 + the UDP socket gone, Storm's join *bookkeeping* retained. (Full Storm removal
  — replacing join with direct state-setup calls — is a later, optional step "C".)
- **Lobby turns ride the reliable control stream**, not the datagram turn path. In-game turns ride
  datagrams (`Payload` with `game_frame_count`); lobby turns are control-stream frames
  (`game_frame_count = None`).
- **IN hook = full replacement of `receive_storm_turns` (`0x73f4e0`)** — never call orig. Verified
  against the 12409 BNDB. Covers both callers (`step_network` + the lobby-init receive-only sibling
  `sub_747250`). See the updated guide §5.1.

## What's landed (this slice)

| Area | File | State |
|---|---|---|
| samase symbol surface | `game/scr-analysis/src/lib.rs` | ✅ all turn/pipe/leave symbols exposed |
| rp2 dependency | `game/Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock` | ✅ pinned to SHA `e8916614…`; builds i686 |
| Credential wire type | `game/src/app_messages.rs` (`NetcodeV2Setup`, `NetcodeV2Relay`, `Secret`) | ✅ redacted `Debug` |
| App-socket parse | `game/src/app_socket.rs` (`netcodeV2Setup`) | ✅ payload redacted from logs + error ctx |
| GameState plumbing | `game/src/game_state.rs` (`SetNetcodeV2Setup`, `netcode_v2_setup`) | ✅ non-gating stash |
| Identity + TLS trust | `game/src/netcode_v2/credentials.rs` | ✅ pinned-cert, fail-closed, unit-tested |
| Seam state scaffold | `game/src/netcode_v2/mod.rs` (`SeamState`) | ✅ types + handoff + directive tracking; hook bodies TODO |

**Nothing is hooked yet** — the live netcode path is unchanged. `SeamState` and the credential
builder are not yet called by anything (hence the module-level `#![allow(dead_code)]`, to be removed
when the hooks land).

## What's next (in rough order)

### 1. Async setup: dial the relay, spawn the driver
On the DLL's existing Tokio runtime (see `lib.rs::async_thread` / `ASYNC_RUNTIME`), when a
`NetcodeV2Setup` is present:
```rust
let creds = netcode_v2::SessionCredentials::from_setup(&setup)?;   // pure, done
let endpoint = netcode_v2::bind_endpoint(creds.roots)?;            // needs the runtime, done
let link = endpoint.connect(creds.home.addr, &creds.home.server_name, &creds.identity).await?;
let (driver, channels) = rally_point_client::LinkDriver::new(link);
tokio::spawn(driver.run());                                        // Tokio half of the seam
// hand `channels` + local_slot + initial latency to SeamState::new, store where the BW hooks reach it.
```
`endpoint`/`ClientEndpoint` must stay alive for the session (it owns the UDP socket). Decide where
`SeamState` lives so the BW-thread hooks can reach it (a `Mutex`/`RecurseCheckedMutex` global in
`bw_scr.rs`, like the other hook state). `driver.run()`'s `Err` return = link failure = treat as the
player dropping (no reconnect yet — D11).

### 2. Install the three hooks (`bw_scr.rs`)
Resolve the addresses from the newly-exposed `scr_analysis::Analysis` getters, declare hooks in the
`hooks` module (`whack_hooks!`), install like the existing `StepNetwork`/`StepIo` examples. Bodies:

- **OUT — `send_turn_message`.** Hand the assembled `(buffer_ptr, len)` to
  `SeamState::submit_local_turn(commands, frame)`. `frame = Some(game_frame_count)` in-game, `None`
  in lobby. (For lobby turns the client crate must divert them to the reliable control stream — see
  §4 below; today `submit_local_turn` only pushes the datagram `outbound` channel.)
- **IN — full-replace `receive_storm_turns`.** Do **not** call orig. Loop `SeamState::try_recv_turn()`,
  feed each `payload.buffer_directive` to `observe_directive(_, next_frame)`, map `payload.slot →
  storm id`, write `player_turns[storm]` / `player_turns_size[storm]` / `net_player_flags[storm] |=
  0x10000|0x20000`. **Own the command buffers in `SeamState`** (they must outlive the whole
  `step_network` dispatch — guide §5.4 #4; don't point at freed channel memory). Then
  `apply_due_directive(next_frame)`, run `set_rng_enable(1) → apply_pending_player_leaves →
  set_rng_enable(orig)`, and return readiness (all required slots present ? 1 : 0). Call
  `mark_turn_executed()` per dispatched turn to advance the PIPE cursor.
- **PIPE — replace `flush_local_turns_to_latency_depth`.** Loop `while outstanding_turns() <
  latency_turns() { flush one turn }` using `SeamState`, not the native
  `builtin_turn_latency + net_user_latency`.

### 3. slot ↔ storm-id mapping
Native join assigns storm ids in join order, so the map is learned during lobby init. Populate
`SeamState::map_slot(slot, storm_id)` as players join (SB already tracks this in
`game_thread/lobby_init.rs` / the lobby setup path — find where storm ids are assigned and mirror
it). The token's slot is the rp2 slot; the BW arrays are indexed by storm id.

### 4. rally-point2 asks (coordinate with that team)
- **Opaque session/lobby `ControlFrame` kind.** For scope B we need Storm's join packets (and lobby
  turns, per the reliable-stream decision) to ride the rp2 reliable control stream. Today
  `ControlFrame` only has `oversize_turn: Payload`. Ask for an opaque blob frame kind
  (addressed to a slot / broadcast within the session) + client send/recv API + relay forwarding.
  This is the architecture doc's reserved "chat/resync/lobby-control future frame kinds."
- Until that exists, lobby turns / join can't fully move off Storm-SNP; a **temporary** interim is
  to keep join on the existing SNP→rally-point-v1 path while in-game turns run on rp2 (that's "scope
  A" as a stepping stone), but the agreed target is B.

### 5. Safety rails (guide §5.5, §6)
- **Self-test before committing a game to the transport:** round-trip a known turn through the seam
  at startup; on failure fall back to native/rally-point networking for the session.
- **Offset plausibility gates:** e.g. `builtin_turn_latency == 2`, sane latency-loop math; on failure
  fall back rather than risk a desync.
- **Suppress the native latency knob + turn-rate commands** (`0x55`/`0x5f`/`0x66`): the relay owns
  latency via `buffer_directive` (applied out-of-band by `apply_due_directive`); a user clicking the
  in-game latency knob must not desync expectation vs reality (dev-note gotcha #2 / guide §5.3).

### 6. Still-open / blocked
- **`pending_leave_reason` samase analyzer** (guide §6 gap #1) — not exposed yet; blocks the
  *server-agreed deterministic* leave write. Interim: call native `apply_pending_player_leaves`
  (parity). Ping the samase owner to add the analyzer (anchor inside `apply_pending_player_leaves`,
  ~`0x7507e9`; **not** a fixed delta from `net_players`).
- **Synced player-leave determinism** and **reconnect/failover (D11)** are open designs — don't
  invent leave/reconnect handling at the seam unilaterally.

## Security notes (done here; keep these invariants)

- **Private key never logged.** `Secret` redacts `Debug`; `app_socket` special-cases `netcodeV2Setup`
  to keep the raw payload out of both the debug log and the `context()` error string. If you add new
  error paths that touch the setup, do **not** format the key. (Plaintext still lives in memory until
  drop — zeroization-on-drop is a noted follow-up needing the `zeroize` crate.)
- **TLS trust is pinned + fail-closed.** `SessionCredentials::from_setup` trusts only the relay leaf
  cert(s) the coordinator sent — no webpki roots, no system roots, no accept-any. An empty/malformed
  cert set is an error, never a silently-empty store. Don't "helpfully" add fallback roots; direct
  relay IPs (D3) mean there is no public CA to fall back to.
- **Token decoded, not trusted-as-sent.** session/slot/tenant come from decoding the signed token,
  not from separate fields. Key↔token match is checked by the relay (challenge response), by design.
- **Version skew is a feature.** We consume rally-point-client's re-exported quinn/rustls so the DLL
  and transport can't drift; ALPN mismatch is rejected at the TLS handshake. When bumping the rp2
  pin, rebuild both sides.
