@rem This script should be called with the current version number of the
@rem server. It should generally not be called manually, but rather by using the
@rem NPM scripts (`yarn deploy` or `yarn deploystaging`).
@rem
@rem Since it is intended for building deployable artifacts, it requires a clean
@rem git working directory (e.g. no uncommitted changes).
@rem
@rem Example of running it manually:
@rem  - "deploy.bat 6.1.2"
@rem  - "deploy.bat $npm_package_version" (if run from a npm script)
